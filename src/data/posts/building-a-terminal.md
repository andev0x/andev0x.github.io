# 🖥️ Building a Terminal-Inspired Web Interface

In this post, we'll explore how to create a web interface that captures the essence of terminal computing while maintaining modern usability.



## 🎯 Goals

Creating a terminal-inspired interface requires balancing nostalgia with functionality. We need to:

- ✅ Maintain readability with high contrast colors  
- ⌨️ Implement keyboard navigation for power users  
- 📱 Ensure responsive design across devices  
- ⚡ Optimize performance for smooth animations  



## 🎨 Color Palette

We use a carefully selected palette:

- **Background:** `#0a0a0a` (near-black)  
- **Primary:** `#00FF00` (neon green)  
- **Accents:** Various shades of green  



## ✍️ Typography

- **VT323** for body text and headings  
- **Press Start 2P** for UI accents  
- **Monospace** for code blocks  



## 🧭 Vim-style Navigation

Vim-style keyboard controls enhance the terminal experience:

- `j` / `k` for scrolling  
- `g` / `G` for top/bottom navigation  
- `/` to activate search  

```javascript
// Example keyboard handler
const handleKeyDown = (event) => {
  switch (event.key) {
    case 'j':
      window.scrollBy(0, 100);
      break;
    case 'k':
      window.scrollBy(0, -100);
      break;
    case '/':
      activateSearch();
      break;
  }
};
```
