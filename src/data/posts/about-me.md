# 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm **andev0x** — real name *An Van Nguyen* — a passionate developer who enjoys building robust systems, crafting clean backend architecture, and continuously learning.

I care deeply about developer experience, maintainable codebases, and minimal yet powerful tooling.



## 🔍 Interests

- ⚙️ Backend development  
- 🧱 System design & architecture  
- 🌐 Distributed computing  
- 📚 Writing, documenting, and sharing with the dev community  



## 💻 Full-Stack Developer

While my heart is in the backend, I’m fully comfortable moving across the stack to bring ideas to life.

### 🛠️ Favorite Tools & Technologies

- **Languages:** Go, Rust, Swift, Python, Dart  
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript  
- **Tooling:** Vite, Tailwind CSS, Neovim, Ghostty  
- **Philosophy:** “The simpler the better — optimize until it can’t be optimized anymore.”



## 🌱 Developer Philosophy

I'm always building, learning, and refining.

**I believe in:**

*_Clean, testable, and readable code  
*_Small, composable tools over big frameworks  
*_Open source contribution and tech as a force for good  
*_Building projects that solve real problems
